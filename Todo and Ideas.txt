Forced Entry mode:
Start with one vehicle and nothing but the weapons we already have. Have to capture a zone to place the HQ.

Make a civilian Relation system
This would take a hell of a lot of work.

Finish making the zone quick response force, and the zone capture response force

Make it where the zone response forces have some serious firepower compared to a regular QRF

Make more enemy base prefabs.

Go through and make all friendly and enemy units for the next map.
