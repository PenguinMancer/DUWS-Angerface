Forced Entry mode:
Start with one vehicle and nothing but the weapons we already have. Have to capture a zone to place the HQ.

Make a civilian Relation system
This would take a hell of a lot of work.

Make it where the zone response forces have some serious firepower compared to a regular QRF

Make more enemy base prefabs.
(serious defensive capabilities?, mortars, MG emplacements, etc.)

Go through and make all friendly and enemy units for the next map.

make actual physical alarms that have to be used by opfor units for an alarm to go off.

Make enemy spawns based more on AP, same with our units.

Test if the alterations to the capture scripts allow opfor to recap zones now.
