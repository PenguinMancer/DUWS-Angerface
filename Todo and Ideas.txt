Forced Entry mode:
Start with one vehicle and nothing but the weapons we already have. Have to capture a zone to place the HQ.

Make a civilian Relation system
This would take a hell of a lot of work.

Make more enemy base prefabs.
(serious defensive capabilities?, mortars, MG emplacements, etc.)

New skill earnable from XP. Backup magazine, gives player a free magazine for held/all weapons? Gotta see what's possible with sqf.

Consider making warcom loop an FSM?
