Forced Entry mode:
Start with one vehicle and nothing but the weapons we already have. Have to capture a zone to place the HQ.

Make a civilian Relation system
This would take a hell of a lot of work.

Finish making the zone quick response force, and the zone capture response force

Make it where the zone response forces have some serious firepower compared to a regular QRF

Make more enemy base prefabs.
(serious defensive capabilities?, mortars, MG emplacements, etc.)

Go through and make all friendly and enemy units for the next map.

Make an alarm go off when we are detected in an enemy zone?
Done, except now we have to figure out how loud it needs to be.

make actual physical alarms that have to be used by opfor units for an alarm to go off.

redo the zone cap script so that there's some way for it to be recaptured multiple times. as it stands the trigger can only go once, preventing a multiple capture bug. If there could be a way to delete the trigger after capture and remake it, that would be perfect.

change the random vehicle calls to pull from a list of vehicles that can be defined in soldier functions, so I don't have to worry about changing multiple files.

Make a zone marker for HQ so that we have an indicator of the size of the HQ location.

Take a look at that XML parsing error in the RPT logs.
