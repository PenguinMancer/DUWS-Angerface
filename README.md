## Overview
DUWS-Angerface randomly generates a campaign with enemy zones to capture. You can also choose to manually place your HQ and enemy
zones to make your own unique campaign. The key of this mission is to have maximum replay-ability, where the player can
setup their own campaign or let the DUWS Angerface create everything randomly for them. You can play with the DUWS Angerface on any
island you want, you just have to rename the .pbo file. Keep in mind though that the enemies and friendly units in these locations may have camos that are inappropriate for that area, due to Angerface being constantly changed depending on the map that my squad and I play next.

### Quick Start
Put the .pbo inside your `Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3\Missions` and/or `Steam\SteamApps\common\Arma 3\MPMissions` folder.
When you are asked to choose the campaign settings, just use the default parameters until you are ready to start changing the settings.
Keep note that "Quick start" may be a bit of a misnomer due to the vast requirement of addons for this mission. Along with that DUWS Angerface has a requirement of the "custom units" addon that's in this repository.

### Required Add-ons:
Many. Besides the required addons though, you can use all the add-ons you want: islands, weapons, gear, etc... Note that the DUWS Angerface
will not show add-ons that adds new units/vehicles, since they are added by hand.

### Using the mission on another island
Just rename the .pbo to the extension of the other island. That's all you need to do. 
 * Example: DUWS_Angerface.stratis.pbo >> DUWS_Angerface.chernarus.pbo
 
### Manually placing zones
After a location for the HQ has been selected the player will be prompted with a dialog with various options. Three buttons will be shown at this time. Random will naturally generate zones randomly. Manual and advanced both allow manual zone placement. The latter though, allows the host to readjust the parameters of each zone after the previous has been placed. This allows the host to make a plethora of zones very accurately, ranging from huge to tiny.

## Features
 * Play the way you want:
   * Play as a lone wolf or as a special forces team, using support assets and gadgets and perform side missions
   * Control your personal squad of troopers and fight against the OPFOR
 * Pretty much every location is randomly generated on the map, from the HQ to enemy zones and side missions.
 * Random side missions, with randomly generated names
 * Play the DUWS-Angerface on any island you want to.
 * Several support options to unlock (UAV, Arty, Personal FLIR, ...)
 * You can define the HQ location yourself and the enemy zones, or just the HQ and let the mission generate the zones automatically. You can also let the mission determine the HQ location itself. Basically you decide the level of randomization.
