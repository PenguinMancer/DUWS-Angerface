As far as we can tell, the enemies are drawing out of the AO, but the fact of the matter is, we still have no idea who these people are. We have a lead though. Remember that strange device you picked up? It's some sort of hard drive. The men back in HQ are working on the encryption now, but the device itself is letting off a radioactive signiture. A very specific one, coming from a certain Ukrainian ghost town. Head to Chernobyl, men, and see what you can find. This is a G4S op now, so from now on you'll be answering directly to me. Dismissed.";
